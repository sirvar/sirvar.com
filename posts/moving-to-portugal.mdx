I recently made the **6,000km** move from Canada to Portugal on their D8 Digital Nomad Visa. For those of you who are either considering or in the process of your application, I've compiled a list of things I've learned that may be helpful to you.
### Applying for the visa
I applied directly with the Portuguese consulate in Toronto, Canada. The first step is to collect all the required documents as outlined [here](https://toronto.consuladoportugal.mne.gov.pt/images/vistos/en/digital_nomadsdr_en.pdf). Then, you must submit the documents and select an appointment date from their [portal](https://pedidodevistos.mne.gov.pt/VistosOnline/).  

You must also bring these printed documents to your appointment, along with a passport photo and a prepaid Canada Post envelope. During this step, they will keep your passport and will mail it back to you. Your passport will contain a temporary four-month, two-entry visa and an appointment date with [SEF/AIMA](https://aima.gov.pt/pt) in Portugal.
### Getting your Portuguese documents
In order to apply for your residence permit, you'll be asked to provide a **NIF** & **NISS** number. 
#### NIF
This is your tax ID which is required to open a [bank account](#bank-account). You can visit a tax office to obtain this, but I found that an online service like [e-residences](https://e-residence.com/nifonline/) was the simplest option, as they become your tax representative. Use promo code **DIGITALNOMAD** to save an extra €10.
#### NISS
Some people have applied without obtaining a NISS but I was asked for one. Since it's free, I recommend getting it just in case. You can fill out [this form](https://www.seg-social.pt/pedido-de-formulario-niss-cidadao-estrangeiro) online and wait a few days for an e-mail confirming that it's been allocated. After that, you can [visit a branch](https://www.seg-social.pt/servicos-de-atendimento) to get your document.
### Bank Account
Once you have obtained your **NIF**, you can open a Portuguese bank account. I have heard reports of them accepting [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/), but since they provide a Lithuanian IBAN, I recommend going with a Portuguese bank instead.

[ActivoBank](https://www.activobank.pt/en) is a great choice for a free account and the one I went with. Some other options include [Millennium](https://ind.millenniumbcp.pt/en/particulares/Pages/Welcome.aspx), [Abanca](https://www.abanca.pt/pt/), and [Novobanco](https://www.novobanco.pt/english).

After opening your account, you need to transfer **€9,120** and obtain an official bank statement confirming this. Printing your digital statement or screenshot of your account isn't sufficient.
### Your AIMA appointment
After completing all the previous steps, you should have all the proper documentation to attend your appointment with AIMA. They will photocopy your documents, take your picture & fingerprints, and submit your application for your residence permit. Receiving your card usually takes a few weeks, but can take up to 4-5 months.
### What's next?
Congrats, you're all set! If you're reading this before the end of 2024, you should consider applying for the NHR tax regime.
